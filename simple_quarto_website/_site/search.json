It is assumed that there are M frames images within time t, the brightness of each pixel in the region obeys the Gaussian distribution of mean β and standard deviation ε, and the Gaussian distribution of each pixel is independent of each other. The brightness value of each pixel in a continuous video image is regarded as a random process changing with time, which is sharpening processing images, the sequence of pixel (X,Y) brightness value is expressed as: \\[{X_1, X_2, ..., X_M} = {J(X, Y, j),|1 \\leq j \\leq M}\\]\nwhere, J(X, Y, j) represents the continuous image sequence in the remote teaching video after sharpening processing, and represents the brightness value of the pixe (X, Y) l in the jth frame.\nThe set of pixel (X,Y) satisfies the Gaussian distribution within M frames: \\[ Q(X_j) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\epsilon_j}}e^{-f+\\beta/2\\epsilon_j} \\]\nThe table below shows the accuracy test results of face feature extraction by the proposed algorithm, \\(X_1\\) is the length of the face. As shown in the table, the matching degree of the face features of the remote teaching video image detected by the proposed algorithm is 0.98, which has a high matching degree, and the extraction effect is ideal.\nCheck the website for more mathematical symbols.\nLaTex Mathematical Symbols\nThe following sections describe the ways to in which you can control the color theme of Mermaid diagrams:\nExample of a Mermaid Diagram with Quarto’s bult-in themes: Neutral\nflowchart LR\n    A[qmd] --&gt; B(Jupyter)\n    A --&gt; B(knitr)\n    B --&gt; C[md]\n    C --&gt; D(pandoc)\n    D --&gt; E[pdf]\n    D --&gt; E[html]\n    D --&gt; E[docx]\nAlso, check out how to make pie charts using Mermaid Diagram Tools!\nMy Cats"

    "text": "A Review of a ‘Cat Behavior’ Paper\n\n\nA review of cat behavior in relation to disease risk and management options (Lepczyk, Lohr, and Duffy 2015)\n\n\nDomestic cats (Felis catus) are a common household pet and also a notorious invasive species around the world. Because cat numbers have been increasing in many locations it is critical to work on management solutions that help to reduce threats posed by cats. With regard to cat behavior, one of the threats both to cats themselves and the species that they interact with is disease transmission. As part of a broader overview on applying cat behavior to management the focus of this review is to consider different types of cat behaviors and highlight how they relate to disease as a means to help inform management. Specifically, we focus on cat movement, foraging, and cat–human interactions as broad classes of cat behavior that can lead to acquisition and transmission of diseases. In addition, we review the diseases that are commonly harbored by cats, are of growing human health concern, and for which we have reasonable information. Finally, we review the main forms of cat management in order to provide a set of recommendations for use in addressing cat diseases."
