<h3>Face Recognition of Remote Teaching Video Image Based on Improved Frame Difference Method [@wang2023face] </h3>

<!--FORMATED_TEXT_WITH_TWO_COLUMNS-->

<!--FOOTNOTE-->

Face recognition technology[^1] is a vital biometric recognition technology widely employed in computer vision[^2] [^3]. The human face, being a unique and complex visual biological feature, encapsulates a wealth of information. While facial expressions, age, and hairstyles may vary significantly, the human face exhibits a certain level of invariance and individuality, enabling it to serve as a means of identification. However, designing a fully automated face recognition system that can reliably perform under all circumstances remains a significant challenge. The use of biometric identity authentication, leveraging the intrinsic attributes of humans such as uniqueness, stability, and strong security, has become a popular method of verifying one's identity. In recent years, considerable research has been conducted on face recognition technology based on human facial features. This technology offers the advantage of collecting facial data at a distance without the subject's cooperation, thus bypassing the need for active involvement.

Face recognition research is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses pattern recognition, image processing, computer vision, physiology, psychology, and cognitive science. It is closely linked to other biometric identification methods and the interaction between humans and computers.

Distance e-learning is a prominent research focus in the education field. Within remote network teaching, the integration of face recognition technology can assist teachers in monitoring attendance and class dynamics, providing comprehensive insights into the learning process of students. Additionally, through data analysis provided by the face recognition system, teachers can promptly adapt and optimize their teaching progress. Therefore, the application of face recognition technology in remote network teaching holds significant implications for relevant colleges and universities. It is essential for professionals in the field to further enhance research on face recognition technology, grasp its functionalities and technical aspects, and analyze its compatibility with distance teaching requirements to enable effective implementation in educational institutions.

<!--non inline-math LaTex equation using $$ $$-->
<p>In the process of establishing the single Gaussian model, the brightness value of each pixel in the background image is consistent with the Gaussian distribution, so the single Gaussian model can be established for each pixel value in the detection area. It is assumed that there are *M* frames images within time t, the brightness of each pixel in the region obeys the Gaussian distribution of mean &beta; and standard deviation &epsilon;, and the Gaussian distribution of each pixel is independent of each other. The brightness value of each pixel in a continuous video image is regarded as a random process changing with time, which is sharpening processing images, the sequence of pixel *(X,Y)* brightness value is expressed as: $${X_1, X_2, ..., X_M} = {J(X, Y, j),|1 \leq j \leq M}$$

where, *J(X, Y, j)* represents the continuous image sequence in the remote teaching video after sharpening processing, and represents the brightness value of the pixe *(X, Y)* l in the *j*th frame. 

The set of pixel *(X,Y)* satisfies the Gaussian distribution within *M* frames: $$ Q(X_j) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\epsilon_j}}e^{-f+\beta/2\epsilon_j} $$

<!--inline-math LaTex equation using $-->
Among them, 
$Q(X_j)$ is the Gaussian distribution of features. The mean $\beta_j$ and standard devaition $\epsilon_j$ of the set of pixel $(X,Y)$ within *M* frames are $\beta_j=\frac{1}{M}\Sigma_{j=0}^{M-1}f_j$, $\epsilon_j=\frac{1}{M}\Sigma_{j=0}^{M-1}f_j-\beta_j$,
where, $f_j$ represents the grey value of any pixel $(X,Y)$ in the j<sup>th</sup> frame. 
<br>
<br>
<p>The table below shows the accuracy test results of face feature extraction by the proposed algorithm, $X_1$ is the length of the face. As shown in the table, the matching degree of the face features of the remote teaching video image detected by the proposed algorithm is 0.98, which has a high matching degree, and the extraction effect is ideal.</p>

<h3>Going over Quarto: Mermaid Diagrams</h3>
<!--Blockquote using '>'-->
> **What is Mermaid?** <br>
> Mermaid is a flowchart and diagram visualization tool based on JavaScript and uses syntax inspired by Markdown in order to create and dynamically modify flowcharts.

<!--Bulleted List-->
<p>The following sections describe the ways to in which you can control the color theme of Mermaid diagrams: </p>

* Using the current document theme
* Using Quarto's bootswatch built-in themes:
  - Darkly
  - Sandstone
  - Vapor
* Using one of Mermaid own color themes via a YAML option.
  - default
  - dark
  - forest
  - neutral
* Using SCSS and CSS variables

<p> Example of a Mermaid Diagram with Quarto's bult-in themes: Neutral </p>
* Using one of Mermaid own color themes via a YAML option.
  - default
  - __dark__
  - forest
  - __neutral__

Putting the mermaid diagram with `neutral` theme in the second panel tabset did not work, so I put an image of it and put the actual mermaid diagram instead, outside of the panel.

Hello. This is Hannah Kim and am a graduate student in Georgetown University majoring in Masters of Science in Data Science and Analytics. I am interested in Statistics (I though I was interested), Computer Networks and Cloud computing. But overall, I love Data Science and Visualization. I think visual effects have an extremely big impact when it comes to presenting. So, though I am not sure with what I will do after two year, I hope to work in a company where visualizaiton takes a huge part. I graduated my undergrad in South Korea an area in Software Engineering. But because of the rigorous program, I was so intimidated by coding that I hesitated a lot before I come here to Georgetown. So I deferred my program a year and worked as a Technical Support Analyst at Medtronic for a year. It was fun working as a Technical Support Analyst because it involves a lot of communication and meeting new people. Outside of school, I love coffee and I love to go out, so I often go to coffee shops and stay there for the whole day. I have a twin sister living in Ottawa who lives with her boyfriend and she is my best friend in the world. I am a huge animal lover, especially cats. I have two cats in my hometown: Pepper, Button, and kept Cabbage for approximately two months. Checkout the videos to see how cute they are![^my_intro]
